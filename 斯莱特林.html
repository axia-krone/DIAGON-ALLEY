            <h2><font color="#000000"><br>Congratulations!<br>
I'm prefec tGemma Farley,  and it's my pleasure to welcome you to Slytherin House<br>
our house symbol is the wisest of animals: the snake<br>
Our house colors are emerald and silver<br>
The entrance to our common room was in a hideaway in the dungeon.<br>
And when you get in there,<br>
Out of the window you could see the bottom of the Black Lake.<br>
We often see giant squid swimming around on the bottom of the lake,<br>
Sometimes more interesting creatures can be seen.<br>
We love that our common room has such a mysterious,<br>
The atmosphere of a shipwreck at the bottom of the sea.<br>
Now, here are a few things about Slytherin<br>
You need to figure out --<br>
Of course there are some things you need to forget.<br>
First, let me solve some of your mysteries.<br>
You may have heard the rumours about Slytherin House<br>
- These rumours say we all love the dark arts;<br>
Or if your great-great-grandfather was a famous wizard,<br>
We will talk to you;<br>
Or any of that crap.<br>
Well,<br>
The things that come out of the mouths of the colleges that compete with us,<br>
You should take it with a grain of salt.<br>
I do not deny that there are many members of our House among dark wizards today,<br>
But the other three colleges are full of them, too<br>
They just don't want to admit it.<br>
This picture looks like a rat...<br>
Yeah, well, traditionally speaking,<br>
We like to recruit those<br>
From a long line of wizards,<br>
But now,<br>
You can find many fellows in our college<br>
Have at least one Muggle parent/mother.<br>
Here's one of the other three colleges<br>
Little-known facts that are rarely mentioned:<br>
Merlin is a Slytherin.<br>
Yes, Merlin himself,<br>
The famous wizard of all time!<br>
He did his whole life's work in this college!<br>
(Note: Merlin is six hundred years before the Big Four, so this is basically Slytherin bragging... From the perspective of Merlin, Merlin should have a clear Hufflepuff personality)<br>
Do you want to follow in Merlin's footsteps?<br>
Or would you rather sit in the famous former Hufflepuff,<br>
Inventor of the self-cleaning dish towel<br>
In front of Egrantine Pfitt's old desk?<br>
I don't think you do.<br>
About how we're not what the rumors say we are<br>
That's pretty much explained.<br>
Let's talk about what we are,<br>
And the coolest school in the world,<br>
The most advanced and outstanding college in all aspects.<br>
We're in it for the win,<br>
Because we care about Slytherin honor and tradition.<br>
We are also respected by students from other colleges.<br>
Yes, some of that respect may be tinged with fear,<br>
It's because of our reputation for the dark arts.<br>
But you know what?<br>
A reputation for doing things no one else dared to do<br>
It's fun, too.<br>
To give a hint to the students in the other house<br>
You have permission to read all the books in the library<br>
See if anyone dares to scribble on your pencil case again.<br>
But we're not bad people.<br>
We also like our college symbol, the snake:<br>
Smooth, capable, and often misunderstood.<br>
For example, we Slytherins are concerned about our own results<br>
More so than Ravenclaw.<br>
And in that respect we Slytherins<br>
More like siblings, ie less like the Joneses.<br>
The corridors of Hogwarts always surprise the unwary,<br>
So when you walk around the school,<br>
You'll be glad to have the people of the Snake Yard by your side.<br>
For us,<br>
Once you're a member of the Snake Yard,<br>
You are one of us<br>
A member of the elite.<br>
Ravenclaws are not only the nerdiest bunch of people you'll ever meet,<br>
They were also known for comparing their academic achievements with each other,<br>
Because you know Salazar Slytherin<br>
Looking for something in his chosen student? -<br>
Great qualifications.<br>
You were assigned to this house,<br>
Because you can be in the real physical world,<br>
To be called great.<br>
Well, maybe you'll see a few people hanging out in the common room,<br>
You may think that they are not destined to achieve something.<br>
That's a thought. Don't say it.<br>
Because if the sorting hat puts them here,<br>
There must be something great about them,<br>
Don't forget that.<br>
Speaking of people who are not destined for great things,<br>
And I haven't even mentioned the Gryffindors.<br>
Now, a lot of people say Slytherin and Gryffindor<br>
It's two sides of the same coin.<br>
Personally, I think the Gryffindors are just<br>
They're just a bunch of Slytherins.<br>
Mind you, some people say Salazar Slytherin and<br>
Godric Gryffindor focused on equally talented students,<br>
So maybe we're more like them than we think,<br>
But that doesn't mean we have to fraternize with Gryffindors.<br>
They want to beat our hearts<br>
We're still a little short on beating them.<br>
Here are some other things you might need to know:<br>
Our house ghost is the Bloody Barlow.<br>
If you can get him to like you,<br>
Occasionally he'll agree to scare someone for you.<br>
Just don't ask him why he's all bloody,<br>
He didn't like the question.<br>
The password to the common room is changed every two weeks.<br>
Keep an eye on the bulletin board.<br>
Never bring anyone from another house<br>
Our common room or give them the password.<br>
Our common room has been around for over 700 years<br>
No one else has been in here.<br>
Okay, I think that's about it.<br>
I'm sure you'll like our dorm.<br>
Our old bed had four drapes,<br>
Green silk hung, and the bedspread was embroidered with silver threads.<br>
The walls are covered with medieval tapestries,<br>
It depicts the great adventures of the famous Slytherins.<br>
A silver lantern hung from the ceiling.<br>
Listening to the lake lapping against the window at night,<br>
You will sleep soundly.<br>
Again, congratulations on being<br>
One of the greatest of Slytherins.<br>
