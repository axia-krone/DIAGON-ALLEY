            <h1>You might belong in Hufflepuff<br>
                Where they are just and loyal<br>
                Those patient Hufflepuff are true <br>
                And unafraid of toil<br></h1>
        </div>

		<div class="text">
            <h2><font color="#000000"><br>Congratulations! I'm Prefect Briere Truman, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to Hufflepuff.<br>
            Our college logo is the Badger,<br>
It's an animal that's often underestimated,<br>

Unless attacked,<br>

Otherwise he would have been sitting quietly in a corner;<br>

But when you get provoked,<br>

It can fight animals much larger than itself,<br>

Including wolves.<br>

The colors of our college are yellow and black.<br>

The common room is located on the ground floor,<br>

It's down the hall from the kitchen.<br>


Now, there are a few things you need to know

Something about Hufflepuff<br>



First, let's talk about one<br>

It has long been a common myth:<br>

We have the lowest IQ in the whole of Hogwarts.<br>

Big mistake!<br>

Hufflepuff must be the most modest of houses,<br>

But the good wizards we've created<br>

No less than other colleges.<br>

You want to see the proof?<br>

Look at Glogan Stamp,<br>

One of the most popular ministers in the history of the Ministry,<br>

He was a Hufflepuff graduate,<br>

There are also super-successful ministers<br>

Artemisia Lufkin and Dougal McPhail.<br>

And then there's the world authority on fantastic Beasts<br>

Newt Scamander,<br>

And then there's Bridget Winlock,<br>

She was a famous arithmancy diviner in the 13th century,<br>

He was also the first to discover that the number seven had magical powers.<br>

Don't forget Hengist. He's next to Hogwarts<br>

Created an all-witch Hogsmeade.<br>


These wonderful people are all from<br>

Hufflepuff graduated.<br>

So as you can see,<br>

We have so many strong, great,<br>

And brave wizards.<br>



But, just because of us<br>

I don't like to spread this around,<br>

We don't get the praise we deserve.<br>



Hufflepuffs, how special,<br>

Anyone who thinks of themselves as having accomplished anything outstanding<br>

They all came out of their college.<br>

I got into serious trouble in my third year for fighting a Ravenclaw prefects who insisted that Bridget Winlock was from their house and not us Hufflepuffs,<br> and I should have been banned for a week, but Professor Sprout only gave me a warning and a box of coconut ice cream.<br>

Hufflepuffs are loyal and trustworthy,<br>

We never argue with others,<br>

But we're not easy to bully,<br>

Like our court emblem, the Badger,<br>

We will defend ourselves against the enemy,<br>

Our friends and family,<br>



I'm not scared at all!<br>

Yet Hufflepuff was weak in one area --<br>

We're the least dark wizard-rich house on this campus.<br>

Of course, you know,<br>

Slytherin always makes bad guys in bulk,<br>

Because they had never heard of fair play,<br>

Compared to working hard<br>

They obviously prefer to cheat.<br>


And Gryffindor, in fact<br>

(The college with which we have the best relationship)<br>

There have been some dishonest people.<br>


What else do you need to know?<br>



Oh, and the entrance to the common room<br>

Hidden in a corner on the right-hand side of the kitchen hallway<br>

In a pile of big barrels.<br>



To the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff.<br>

Tap lightly on the bottom of the second bucket in the middle of the second row,<br>

The lid will spin open.<br>



We're the only ones at Hogwarts<br>

With an academy for exorcising magic against potential invasions,<br>



If you hit the wrong cap, <br>or

Knock at the wrong tempo,<br> and an illegal intruder will be splashed with vinegar.


You'll hear from other houses<br>

Bragging about their security,<br>

But for more than a thousand years,<br>

Hufflepuff's common room and dormitory<br>

Never seen by outsiders.<br>



We're like badgers,<br>

Know exactly how to keep a low profile --<br>

And how to protect ourselves.<br>



Once you open the bucket,<br>

Climb in, follow the passageway behind it,<br>

You will arrive in the common rooms of all colleges<br>

The most comfortable one.<br>



It's a circular,<br>

A room full of the smell of earth,<br>

With low ceilings;<br>

It always feels sunny,<br>

And looking out of the round window,<br>



You can see swaying grass and dandelions.<br>

There's a lot of shiny copper here,<br>

There are also many plants from the ceiling<br>

Hang or arrange on a windowsill.<br>



Our dean, Professor Pomona Sprout<br>

In charge of teaching herbology,<br>

She took the most interesting samples<br>

(Some of them can dance and talk)<br>

To decorate our break room<br>

This is also the herbology of Hufflepuffs<br>

It's usually pretty good for one reason.<br>


We have upholstered sofas and chairs<br>

It's all yellow and black,<br>

A circular door in the wall of the common room<br>

To our dormitory.<br>

Copper lamps cast a warm glow over our four-poster bed,<br>

The bed was covered with napkins,<br>

If your feet get cold easily,<br>

There are also copper heaters hanging on the walls<br>

In case you need it.<br>


The resident ghost of our college is<br>

The friendliest ghost of all:<br>

The Fat Friar<br>


You'll be able to spot him easily:<br>

He was fat and dressed in the robes of a monk,<br>

If you get lost or in any kind of trouble,<br>

He'll be glad to help you.<br>

You can have a good sleep.<br>

We are in our dormitory<br>

Protection from wind and rain;<br>

We've never been like the people who live in the towers<br>

That sometimes gets interrupted at night.<br>

Again, congratulations on being

The nicest, most decent, most resilient institution

				One of them.</font></h2>
