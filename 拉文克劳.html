            <h2><br>Congratulations!<br>
I'm Prefect Robert Hilliard, and it's my great pleasure to welcome you to Ravenclaw College<br>
Our symbol is the eagle<br>
-- Soaring high above the peaks that no one can reach<br>
The colors of our house are blue and bronze<br>
Our common room sits atop Ravenclaw Tower,<br>
After an enchanted door knocker.<br>
Looking through the arched Windows of the round lounge,<br>
You can see the whole school,<br>
The lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch Pitch and the herbology greenhouse.<br>
Other colleges are not so blessed.<br>
Say without boasting,<br>
This is where the wisest witches and wizards live.<br>
With our founder<br>
-- Roina Ravenclaw,<br>
We should make learning our first ability.<br>
We don't have to be like other colleges<br>
Hide the entrance to the lounge.<br>
Our common room entrance is located<br>
At the top of a long, winding staircase, with no handle,<br>
But there was an enchanted bronze door knocker in the shape of an eagle.<br>
When you knock, the Eagle Ring will ask you a question,<br>
If you can answer correctly, you'll be allowed in.<br>
For nearly a thousand years,<br>
This simple little obstacle is already going to<br>
All students outside Ravenclaw were shut out.<br>
Some first-years were afraid of the eagle ring question,<br>
Just relax and don't worry<br>
Ravenclaw was good at learning.<br>
You'll soon enjoy the challenge.<br>
Like twenty men standing in the doorway of the common room,<br>
It's not uncommon to see people working together to find answers to the day's questions.<br>
It's a great opportunity to meet Ravenclaw students from other grades,<br>
You can learn from them.<br>
(Although it can be annoying when you leave your Quidditch uniform behind and have to hurry in and out)<br>
I suggest, therefore, that before you leave Ravenclaw Tower,<br>
Double check that everything you need is in your bag.<br>
Another cool thing about Ravenclaw<br>
Is that we are very self-conscious,<br>
Some might even call us weirdos.<br>
Unlike other colleges,<br>
We think you have a right.<br>
Wear whatever you like,<br>
Believe whatever you want to believe,<br>
Say whatever pleases you.<br>
We don't hate people who are different.<br>
On the contrary, we think they have great potential!<br>
Speaking of weirdos, you're gonna love our dean,<br>
Professor Filius Flitwick.<br>
People often underestimate him,<br>
Because he was very small<br>
(We thought he had goblin blood, but we never asked rudely)<br>
His voice was high,<br>
But he's one of the best in the world,<br>
The most learned master of charms.<br>
The door to his office always opens<br>
Open to any Ravenclaw students with questions.<br>
If you're not happy,<br>
He'd take it out and store it in a tin can in his desk drawer<br>
Those delicious cupcakes to soothe you,<br>
Let them dance in front of you.<br>
In fact, just to watch them dance<br>
Ravenclaw has an illustrious history:<br>
It's worth pretending you're not happy.<br>
Most of the greatest<br>
Wizards inventors and innovators<br>
All from our college.<br>
Including the one who invented the moon mirror<br>
Pepila Vancourt<br>
(Perpetua Fancourt),<br>
The great love potions pioneer,<br>
Lavender Montemorency<br>
(Laverne de Montmorency),<br>
And the guy who invented Floo powder<br>
Ignatia Willsmith<br>
(Ignatia Wildsmith).<br>
The famous Minister of Magic from Ravenclaw<br>
Including Millicent Bagnold<br>
(Millicent Bagnold),<br>
Harry Potter survived the Dark Lord's Curse<br>
He happened to be in office that night,<br>
He defended it with his own words<br>
An act of celebration by witches all over England<br>
"I insist that the celebration is our inalienable right."<br>
Another famous minister was<br>
Roken McClair<br>
(Lorcan McLaird),<br>
He was very clever.<br>
But insist on using only the end of the wand<br>
Smoke to communicate with others.<br>
That's right. We don't get people out of this hospital.<br>
On top of that, weirdo Urick<br>
(Yeah, the weird wizard with the jellyfish hat.)<br>
And a fellow of our Ravenclaw house,<br>
He's the inspiration for a lot of wizarding jokes.<br>
As for our relationship with other schools:<br>
Well, I'm sure you've heard of Slytherin.<br>
They're not all bad people,<br>
But until I get to know them,<br>
You'd better keep an eye out for them.<br>
For a long time,<br>
The tradition of their college is<br>
Win at all costs.<br>
So be aware,<br>
Especially in Quidditch matches and exams.<br>
Gryffindors are all right.<br>
But if I have a problem with them,<br>
It's just that I think their students are too ostentatious.<br>
Also, they are not very patient with others,<br>
Make fun of people who are different from you.<br>
In fact, they made fun of it<br>
Ravenclaws are famous for their interests.<br>
For example, we love floating charms,<br>
To explore the uses of troll snot,<br>
I was also addicted to eggnography,<br>
(As you know, it's an egg divination).<br>
Gryffindor didn't share our intellectual curiosity.<br>
For us,<br>
If you decide to go in the common room<br>
Breaking eggs all day and all night,<br>
The way to predict the yolk's fall,<br>
No one will laugh at you.<br>
In fact, maybe your partner<br>
I'd be happy to give you a hand.<br>
About Hufflepuff...<br>
Well, no one has ever said anything bad about them.<br>
In fact,<br>
They're probably the nicest bunch of people in Hogwarts.<br>
Let's just say that during the exam,<br>
You don't need to worry too much about them getting ahead of you.<br>
I think that's all.<br>
Oh, and the ghost of our college is Lady Gray.<br>
The rest of the school thought she never spoke,<br>
But she actually talks to Ravenclaw students.<br>
If you happen to get lost, or lose something,<br>
She can help you with that.<br>
I'm pretty sure you'll have a nice evening.<br>
Our bedroom was in the little tower near the castle,<br>
The four-poster bed was covered with a sky blue velvet blanket,<br>
Listening to the sound of the wind outside my window,<br>
You will feel very happy.<br>
Congratulations on joining Hogwarts<br>
The smartest, weirdest, funniest house!<br>
Welcome to Ravenclaw!<br><br>
